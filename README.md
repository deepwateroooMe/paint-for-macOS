<h1>Paint for macOS</h1>

<p>Paint for macOS is a simple computer graphics app that I have developed in Swift for macOS. The app mainly opens and saves files (PNG, JPEG, GIF without animation) and provide shapes as (square, triangle, circle) and a freestyle mode that allow you to draw whatever you like to update your images</p>
